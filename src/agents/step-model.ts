/**
 * Pure step-model resolution: preset expansion + model precedence.
 *
 * Extracted from `index.ts` so the launch wiring is testable without herdr.
 * Everything here is a pure function of its inputs — no panes, no process
 * state, no I/O — because the two invariants this module owns are the ones the
 * feature is judged on:
 *
 *   1. A referenced preset's kind/model/thinking reach the child, and its
 *      model beats `agentOverrides` (which `loadCatalog` folds into
 *      `agent.model` before anything here runs).
 *   2. `kind` and the FINAL model are coherent, or the launch is refused
 *      loudly instead of dropping the model at start (`nativeModelFor`).
 *
 * Invariant 2 is checked on the resolved model, NOT on the preset's own
 * `model`: the launched model can come from a level above or below the preset
 * (a per-run tool `model`, `defaultModel`, the dispatch model, an override),
 * so validating the preset's own pair would let an incoherent pair ship.
